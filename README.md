## Andrew's notes

I've tried to incorporate as much best practice and the recent changes in Angular to this project as possible. This includes: Signals, the new control flow syntax as well as the project being module-less. I have also shown easy use of state management using Signals as well as the standard Inputs and Outputs. I have commented on the most important Components as to what I'm doing and my reasoning for doing it.
